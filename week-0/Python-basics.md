# Python Basics
## Getting Started
### Installation and Setup
A guide for installing and setting up Python [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

##Key topics to learn
1. Data structures:
  * [Strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-strings/?ref=lbp): Text data enclosed in quotes.
  * [Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/?ref=lbp): Ordered, mutable sequences.
  * [Tuples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-tuples/?ref=lbp): Ordered, immutable sequences.
  * [Sets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-sets/?ref=lbp): Unordered collections of unique elements.
  * [Dictionary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/?ref=lbp): Key-value pairs, mutable and unordered.
  * [Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-arrays/?ref=lbp): Similar to lists but used for numerical data (mainly via libraries like array or NumPy).
2. Operators: [Python operators geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-operators/?ref=lbp)
Key Operators to Know:
  * Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
  * Relational: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 
  * Logical: and, or, not  
  * Bitwise: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >> 
  * Assignment: =, +=, -=, etc.
  * Identity: is, is not
  * Membership: in, not in
3. Conditions and Loops
Conditions (like if-else) control which code runs based on specific criteria, and can be simple or nested. Loops (such as for and while) repeat actions while a condition is true. Key loop control statements include:
break – exits a loop early,
continue – skips the current iteration.
Make sure to understand:
* for loop
* while loop
* break and continue statements
* if-else, if-elif, and nested conditions

4. Classes and objects:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful method of writing software where you create *classes* to represent real-world entities and *objects* as instances of those classes. A class bundles together data (attributes) and behaviors (methods), and objects created from it inherit this general structure. Methods in classes are similar to regular functions but often include a `self` parameter and may use special methods like `__init__` or `__add__`. Instantiating a class means creating an object from it, allowing each instance to have unique data while sharing the class’s defined behavior.

## Important libraries
You can import these libraries in your Colab notebook by commands like:
 `import numpy as np`
 `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
 `import pandas as pd`
1. NumPy: useful for fast operations on multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions in Python
here is a [w3schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) on NumPy.
2. [Matplotlib](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp): great for visualizations in Python  
3. [Pandas](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp): data analysis and manipulation
