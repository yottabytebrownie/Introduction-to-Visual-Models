This is a guide to setting up your github repository using the web interface.

## 1. Create a GitHub Account

* Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
* Sign up with a username, email, and password.


## 2. Create a New Repository

1. Click the **+** icon in the top right.
2. Select **"New repository"**.
3. Fill in:

   * Repository name [Name it: Intro-to-Visual-Models]
   * You can make a choice of either **Public** or **Private**. But for SoC, keep it public.
4. Check **"Add a README file"** .
5. Click **"Create repository"**.


## 3. Add or Edit Files

You can create, upload, or edit files directly.

### To Add a File

* Go to your repository.
* Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"** or **"Upload files"**.
* For "Create new file":

  * Name your file (`example.py`, `index.html`, etc.)
  * Type your content in the editor.
  * Scroll down and **Commit changes**.
* Or, you could directly upload your .ipynb file 

###  To Edit a File

* Navigate to the file in your repo.
* Click the **pencil icon** ✏️.
* Make your changes and commit.


##  4. Commit Changes

* When creating or editing files, GitHub asks for a **commit message**.
* Keep it short and descriptive (e.g., `First commit to Week-1`).
* Click **"Commit changes"**.


##  5. Create a Branch (for Testing or Features)

* On the main repo page, click the **branch dropdown** (default is `main`).
* Type a new branch name and press Enter.
* This creates a copy of the repo where you can safely test changes.


## 6. Make a Pull Request (PR)

* Once you're done editing in a branch:

  * Click **"Pull requests"** tab → **"New pull request"**.
  * Compare your branch to `main`.
  * Add a title and description.
  * Click **"Create pull request"**.


## 7. Merge Pull Request

* Open your PR.
* Review the changes.
* Click **"Merge pull request"** → **"Confirm merge"**.
* (You can delete the branch after merging.)


##  8. View Commit History

* Click the **"Commits"** link near the top of your repo (next to "branches").
* You’ll see a timeline of changes, commit messages, authors, and timestamps.
